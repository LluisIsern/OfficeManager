# Overview

The application allows us to manage the seats in the office, thanks to
this we will know the people who open that day in the office and where they will be located
lest we find that there are no seats available.

After registering with your credentials, a very intuitive screen will appear
where we can choose seat and day of reservation, we can also book
meeting rooms and mini private rooms to concentrate to the fullest.
